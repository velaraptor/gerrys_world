## Project Description
Gerry's World is a Shiny application primarily created in R. This application allows for a user to modify existing congressional districts in Texas to create new lines that are equal in population and lean towards the actual state voting. 

Our hope is that we can not only teach people how gerrymandering works at a state level, but potentially allow users to crowd source the lines to help legislators and the courts get a better idea of what the citizens of Texas believe are just and fair district lines.

## Data
The data used in the backend on our Postgres Database includes:
* Current ACS Census Tract Data 
	* Income
	* Race
	* Total Population
* 2016 Presidential Results - (ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/elections)
* Shapefiles for Congressional Districts, Voting Districts, and Census Tracts

## Roadmap
Currently the app is being hosted @ https://glasshousepolicy.shinyapps.io/gerrys_world
The app has a native Google Auth login. This a production server so it will not being running as quickly, Currently you can edit the congressional districts and save a shapefile of your edited districts and a copy will be written to the database. 

* The next steps are to migrate this app to either an AWS server or a paid Shinyapp.io server to handle more users & better authentication.
* ~~Add a live leaderboard from submitted user districts.~~
* ~~Create a how to play video to allow users to better understand how to play.~~
* Add Income Dot Map Tile
* ~~Make Login page live.~~
* ~~Save simplified congressional districts to database, to unburden load on app making polygons simplified.~~ 
* Fix potential error with native population numbers. 
* QA Test the shit out of it. 
* ~~Coastal Districts don't have valid geoms, ST_MAKEVALID()~~
* Add Race Component Score
* Add Custom Tiles to Map Box
* Fix jquery issues
* Make polygons not draggable
* ~~Push to ShinyApps.Io~~
* Allow users to see their maps again
* ~~Fix Simplification so not that many vertices.~~ 
* ~~Add Houston Area, Get DB, New Tab, and make Zoom Level More. Bound by counties~~

## Development
To start this Shiny App on your local computer, first make sure you have gdal installed.
```
brew install gdal
```
If you haven't uploaded the most recent version of R, download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

When you first open R, execute this code to correctly download all the dependent libraries. 
```R 
install.packages(c('devtools','rgeos','rgdal','sp','leaflet','DT','dplyr','RPostgreSQL','DBI','shinythemes','shiny','highcharter','googleAuthR','data.table','rpostgis','rmapshaper','leaflet.extras','RJSONIO','geojsonio','shinyjs'),dependencies=T)
devtools::install_github("MarkEdmondson1234/googleID")
```
If you need the credentials to the database, please contact me here or @ [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/velaraptor). 
**FYI trying to run this app without the credentials wont run the app.**
To run new changes from leaflet extras, download the forked version from my account and then run these commands on your shell
```
R CMD BUILD <reponame>
R CMD INSTALL <reporname.tar.gz>
```

Lastly within the directory of this github repo on your local machine, run this code to get an instance of the shiny app on your local machine @ http://localhost:6262.

```R 
library(shiny)
runApp('shiny-app',port=6262)
```
## ShinyProxy and Docker
Currently we will be using an open-source version of Shiny Server, [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/). ShinyProxy allows us to not just add authenticaion, but dockerize the app and be able to scale. 
 ### Instructions
* To edit ShinyProxy pages such as login, clone our forked version of [ShinyProxy](https://github.com/velaraptor/shinyproxy)
* To edit the leaflet.extras library for R, clone our forked version of [Leaflet.Extras](
https://github.com/velaraptor/leaflet.extras)
* For Mac/OSX, have brew install and install these libraries for ShinyProxy
```bash
brew install socat
xcode-select --install
brew install gcc
brew install maven
```
* To build ShinyProxy, run the following code and in the target directory, shinyproxy-1.0.2.jar will be the file you want to see your changes. 
```bash
mvn -U clean install
```
* Make sure you have docker installed, and then run the following commands so ShinyProxy will be able to talk to our Docker Container
```bash
socat TCP-LISTEN:2375,range=127.0.0.1/32,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:/var/run/docker.sock
```
* To create a local docker image from this repo
```bash
docker build -t gerrys_world.dev .
```
* To get master bulid from docker cloud (note if you want to make changes, create a branch, since this image automatically builds from master)
```bash
curl -u username:8bbbd7a9-8304-431e-8533-cd949f92bd7f https://cloud.docker.com/api/app/v1/service/
docker pull velaraptor/gerrys_world
```
* Lastly to see application, edit the application.yml file in this repo and change the docker-image to the corresponding image you want to use. Then run the following code and the application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 
```bash
java -jar shinyproxy-1.0.2.jar
```

## Acknowledgments
In addition to using PostGIS queries to achieve intersection of all the geographical polygons, we would want to thank the guys who created [Leaflet.Extras](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet.extras) that allowed us to edit polygons in a leaflet framework. 

Additionally, QGIS plugin [QTiles](https://github.com/nextgis/QTiles) for allowing us to create map tiles with dot densities for demographics.
