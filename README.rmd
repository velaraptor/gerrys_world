## Project Description
Gerry's World is a Shiny application primarily create in R. This application allows for a user to modify existing congressional districts in Texas to create new lines that are equal in population and lean towards the actual state voting. 

Our hope is that we can not only teach people how gerrymandering works at a state level, but potentially allow users to crowd source the lines to help legislators and the courts get a better idea of what the citizens of Texas believe are just district lines. 

## Data

The data used in the backend on our Postgres Database includes:
* Current ACS Census Tract Data 
	* Income
	* Race
	* Total Population
* [2016 Presidential Results](ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/elections)
* Shapefiles for Congressional Districts, Voting Districts, and Census Tracts

## Roadmap

## Development
To start this Shiny App on your local computer, first make sure you have gdal installed.
```
brew install gdal
```
If you haven't uploaded the most recent version of R, download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). 

When you first open R, execute this code to correctly download all the dependent libraries. 
```R 
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('leaflet')
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('RPostgreSQL')
install.packages('DBI')
install.packages('shinythemes')
install.packages('shiny')
install.packages('highcharter')
install.packages('googleAuthR')
install.packages('data.table')
install.packages('rpostgis')
install.packages('rgdal')
install.packages('rmapshaper')
install.packages('rgeos')
install.packages('sp')
install.packages('leaflet.extras')
devtools::install_github("MarkEdmondson1234/googleID")
```
If you need the credentials to the database, please contact me here or @ [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/velaraptor).

Lastly within the directory of this github repo on your local machine, run this code to get an instance of the shiny app on your local machine @ http://localhost:6262.

```R 
library(shiny)
runApp('shiny-app',port=6262)
```

## Acknowledgments
In addition to using PostGIS queries to achieve intersection of all the geographical polygons, we would want to the guys who create [Leaflet.Extras](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet.extras) that allowed us to edit polygons in a leaflet framework. 

Additionally, QGIS plugin [QTiles](https://github.com/nextgis/QTiles) for allowing us to create map tiles with dot densities for demographics.
